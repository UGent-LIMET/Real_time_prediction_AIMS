##########Frequently got errors##########
#### MAIN ####
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:'
= PATH in main.py is not yet adjusted to computer where you're running

FATAL ERROR: Network error: Connection refused
=Start_Py_pipeline before you startup your experiment, wait few seconds in between so Rbox is ready for use. 


#### REIMS_fingerprint_prediction ####
ValueError: Number of features of the model must match the input. Model n_features is 1150001 and input n_features is 3733 
=> you cannot train eg on different SOURCE_X (eg. train on VM and predict with M3). 
=> you cannot use VMs from diff experiment to train and test. intra-experiment prediction only with VM. Use M2/M3 instead.

ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float32').
= min. 1 MS (column of M3/VM file) contains NAs in intensities, eg. because some preprocessing files (M2s) with and some w/o binning
