# Description: Model is trained with selected ML algorithm for classification of AIMS metabolomics data, prior to real-time prediction.
#			   Real-time prediction classification of new data using saved ML model from “REIMS_fingerprint_training”.
#			   Previously build models and the newly predicted samples can be evaluated for correctness, using a saved ML model from “REIMS_fingerprint_training” and the output from “REIMS_fingerprint_prediction”.

# REIMS_fingerprint_training
# Input: 
# -	Configalternative.R
# -	variableMetadata.txt or matrix3_CopmIDs_all.txt
# - sampleMetadata.txt
# Output: 
# -	pkl file with saved model
# - Feature importances
# - Confusion matrix plot

# REIMS_fingerprint_prediction
# Input:
# - Configalternative.py
# - Saved ML model pkl file
# - variableMetadata.txt or matrix3_CopmIDs_all.txt as the new input feature matrix to predict.
# Output:
# - The script will output a Y_pred.txt file with the classifications given by the model on a variable metadata or matrix3_CopmIDs_all file
 
# REIMS_fingerprint_evaluation
# Input:
# - Configalternative.py
# - sampleMetadata.txt
# - Y_pred.txt file obtained from the “REIMS_fingerprint_prediction” module
# Output:
# - The script will output a tabular file with the true and the predicted classifications
